// Packer => packer is used to create machine images (containing pre-configured software) that we can later use in virtualbox or ec2 machines (also Azure and GCP)
// you can create one packer image and use it in several different cloud environments

// user => create packer HCL files => put it in CI/CD pipeline => push it to AWS/AZURE/DOCKER/...

// packer files look very similar to Terraform files. both use same language and formatting

// go to packer.io to install packer

// packer files end with "pkr.hcl"

$ packer fmt .   // format the code

$ packer validate .   // validate that the code is correct

$ packer init .   // find and install all needed plugins

$ packer build .   // build the image

// if you re-run the same packer script, it will throw an error since the AMI already exists, we should either
// come up with new name each time, or manually delete the running instance.
